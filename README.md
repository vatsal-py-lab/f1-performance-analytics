Formula 1 is one of the most data-rich sports in the world. Every race weekend generates a massive amount of information — from lap times, pit stop strategies, and tyre choices to weather conditions, safety car deployments, and driver performance trends.  

**F1 Data Lab** is designed to bring structure and insight into this complexity by combining:  
- 📊 **Qualitative Analytics** to uncover patterns and factors influencing race outcomes.  
- 🤖 **Predictive Analytics** to predict driver finishing positions and explore strategy optimization.  
- 📈 **Data Visualizations** to create an interactive experience for fans, analysts, and stakeholders.  

This project is not only a technical showcase of **data engineering, analytics, and predictive modeling**, but also a storytelling platform that makes F1 more accessible through **clean dashboards and intuitive insights**.
